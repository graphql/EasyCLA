# Contributing to this repo

This repository is managed by EasyCLA. Project participants must sign the free [ToIP Specification Membership agreement](https://trustoverip.org) before making a contribution. You only need to do this one time, and it can be signed by [individual contributors](https://trustoverip.org) or their [employers](https://trustoverip.org).

To initiate the signature process please open a PR against this repo. The EasyCLA bot will block the merge if we still need a membership agreement from you.

You can find [detailed information here](https://trustoverip.org). If you have issues, please email [info@example.org](mailto:info@example.org).
